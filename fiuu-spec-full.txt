INTRODUCTION
Dealing with banks and multiple payment channels are time-consuming and it might cost you a
lot of money. We also understand that it’s a hassle for those non-technical people to integrate
even one kind of online payment method into their existing website. Thus we consolidate all
payment channels into one integration to reduce merchant’s costs and effort, and to shorten
your time-to-market.
Fiuu, the payment gateway (PG), or previously known as Razer Merchant Services (RMS), is to
help merchants, who sell online and offline, to reach out to the regional buyers, collecting
payment and distributing funds, expanding rapidly to the Southeast Asia market. The service
includes:
● Front-end
○ RWD or responsive web design payment page for online buyer to checkout
○ Secure 1-click payment using credit card tokenization technology, to ease the
payment flow for returning purchase
○ Bcard redemption and rewarding loyalty program for buyers
○ Seamless integration to popup bank login page immediately
○ In-page checkout similar to Stripe and airbnb checkout flow that can seamlessly
integrated with merchant system
○ Mobile XDK allows app developers to implement in-app payments
○ Channel switching is available for same currency channels
○ Fiuu Cash which allows over-the-counter (OTC) payment acceptance
○ Common shopping carts payment module, plugin, addon, or extension supported
● Back-end
○ Server-to-server Notification to ensure no missing status update
○ Callback to update merchant system on deferred status change
○ Merchant can login to control panel to track payment status
○ Scheduled report on daily/weekly/monthly basis to update merchant via email
○ Real-time visualized reports

PAYMENT FLOW OVERVIEW
PG provides hosted payment page service, so that merchants do not require costly and
tech-savvy PCI-DSS compliance at merchant websites or systems. The integration is as simple
as passing parameters via HTTPS POST or GET method from merchant to PG payment page.
Buyer will proceed their transaction on internet banking or any payment channel. Once
completed, PG will redirect the buyer's front-end back to the merchant system, using the POST
method.
IPN (instant payment notification) or ACK from merchants could be implemented to confirm the
receiving of payment status updates.

How to identify and report tech-related issues to PG?
Merchant needs to prepare 3 simple and similar payment endpoint scripts to handle the
payment notification from the payment gateway:
1. Return URL: front-end or browser redirection notification, which are normally not a 100%
reliable and robust channel due to unexpected network connectivity issue or client-side
behavior, such as browser application crashes;
2. Notification URL (webhook): a server-to-server back-end webhook which is more robust
and crucial for payment status or order update;
3. Callback URL (webhook): a special handler webhook to get notified on non-realtime
payment status, such as “deferred status update”, change of payment status, or Fiuu
Cash, which is not a realtime payment naturally.
After the normal payment flow, merchants can always send payment status query requests,
which is defined in reQuery APIs (a.k.a PSQ, Payment Status Query).

SECURITY & DATA INTEGRITY
For online payment. The system uses “merchant ID”, “Verify Key” and “Secret Key” to generate
encrypted hash string to ensure data integrity in the payment process.
Verify Key [Confidential]
Verify Key is unique shared secret for PG merchants to generate request to the payment
gateway. It is a key or seed for generating one-time hash data, which are known as “vcode”
(merchant’s payment request to the gateway) or some of the “skey” (APIs’ request from
merchant to the gateway).
How to get the verify key?
1. Logon to PG Merchant Portal
2. Open up the “Transaction” drop down list in “MAIN NAVIGATION”.
3. Clink on “Settings” option
4. “Verify Key” will be listed at “Integration” tab
5. Clink on Eye Icon to show the “Verify Key”
•••••• is Merchant’s Verify Key provided by the payment gateway. Please make sure it is at least
32 characters. Merchant may request to change the key when necessary.
Secret Key [Top Secret]
Secret Key is a unique shared secret for the payment gateway to generate responses to
merchants. It is a key or seed for generating one-time hash data, which are known as “skey” (in
the payment response) or some of the “VrfKey” (APIs’ response from payment gateway).
Merchant or developer MUST NOT disclose this secret key to the public. Once the key is
suspected to be compromised, please contact PG customer service immediately to reset the
key.

Fiuu ^ Powering Future Payments
Merchants who are using PG mobile xdk MUST use different strings for “Verify Key”(treat it as
public key) and “Secret Key”(treat it like private key), respectively. Contact PG customer service
to reset your keys whenever needed.
vcode (in payment request)
vcode is to ensure the data integrity passed from merchant-end (either website or mobile APP)
to the payment page to avoid man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. It uses “Verify Key”(like a public
key) in combination with the data string for hashing purposes.
It becomes mandatory for each transaction if “Enable Verify Payment” is activated in merchant
profile as shown:-
vcode was generated using MD5 encryption hash function and consists of the following
information (must be set in the following orders) :
1. Transaction amount
2. Merchant ID
3. Order ID
4. Verify Key
Extra parameters which are COMPULSORY for merchants accepting multi currency channels.
To have these values calculated in the hash. Kindly enable it from Merchant Portal
(Transactions -> Settings). Enable the option “Use extended format for Verify Payment” to
include the following, which is essential for digital product or instant delivery services:-
5. Currency
Formula to generate vcode
vcode = md5( {amount}{merchantID}{orderID}{verify_key} )

Formula with extended vcode enabled
vcode = md5( {amount}{merchantID}{orderID}{verify_key}{currency} )
Example to generate vcode for PHP developer
<?php
$amount 	= “27.60”;
$currency 	= “MYR”;
$merchantID = “ACME”;
$orderid 	= “OD8842”;
$verifykey 	= “f5bb0c8de146c67b44babbf4e6584cc0”;
// Replace f5bb0c8de146c67b44babbf4e6584cc0 with your Verify Key
// vcode formula
//$vcode 	= md5( $amount.$merchantID.$orderid.$verifykey ); //extended vcode off
$vcode 	= md5( $amount.$merchantID.$orderid.$verifykey.$currency );
// output of the vcode based on above information equals to :
$vcode 	= “5bf33e6500a53830d4f80087b67e13de”;
?>
Verification tool for vcode
To verify whether the vcode generated is correct, merchant may check on this URL:-
https://api.fiuu.com/RMS/query/vcode.php
What happens if a merchant passes in an incorrect vcode?
An error will be displayed on the payment page as shown:-

skey (in payment response)
skey is a payment gateway generated returning hash string to ensure the payment result data
integrity that passed to the merchant system. Merchants or developers MUST verify this hash
string properly and compare the order ID, currency, amount, and also the payment date/time, to
protect self interest from being cheated by a fraudster/hacker. It uses a “Secret Key”(like a
private key) in combination with a data string for the hashing process.
Please note that there are other “skey” with different formulas in Merchant Request APIs’
parameters. Try not to confuse yourself with this payment response “skey”.
skey was encrypted twice using MD5 encryption hash function and consists of the following
information (must be set in the following orders) :
First hash string
1. Transaction ID
2. Order ID
3. Status
4. Merchant ID (domain)
5. Amount
6. Currency
Final hash string
1. Payment Date/Time
2. Merchant ID (domain)
3. First hash string
4. Approval Code
5. Secret Key

Domain Registration for Merchant Endpoints
The Return URL, Callback URL, Notify URL and including the Cancel URL are the endpoints
that need to be registered. It is important that a merchant register the domain if their endpoints
are different from the main website of the business. Failure to do so may result in the merchant
not receiving transaction statuses or customers not being redirected to the website when they
click the cancel button.
Steps to Register Your Domain:
1. Login to merchant portal
Navigate to https://portal.fiuu.com
2. Go to the Domain Registration Page
Navigate to the domain registration page in your merchant dashboard (UI will be
provided).
3. Enter Your Domain
Input the domain you wish to use for payment requests. Ensure it is properly formatted
and matches the domain you plan to use.
4. Submit for Verification
Once entered, submit the domain for verification by our support team.
5. Verification by Support Team
Our support team will review your domain. If everything is in order, the domain will be
approved. If there are any issues, the registration will be rejected, and you will receive
feedback on what needs to be corrected.
6. Approval and Use
Once the domain is approved, it will be available for use in payment requests. Ensure
that only approved domains are used to avoid any disruptions during transactions.

SIMULATION (Sandbox Account)
Merchants should be provided a sandbox account or developer account from PG, in order to
simulate the payment flow for successful and failure transaction cases.
Sandbox environment is solely for basic integration and validation purposes, DO NOT treat it as
a grant for production environment testing and the configuration and implementation might be
different. “Sandbox” account has a full range of production features for advanced integration
and preparing for UAT purposes.
USER ACCEPTANCE TEST (Developer Account)
For full feature integration and UAT, such as mobile xdk or seamless integration, please request
“Developer” account or “Dev” account from PG. These accounts are all set with a short period of
lifespan for integration and testing purposes only. No settlement and mass payout is allowed in
these accounts.
For real transactions conducted in a “Dev” account, please void or cancel the transaction on the
same day. For Malaysian internet banking, only Maybank, CIMB Clicks, and FPX offers refund
feature. You may request to turn on the channel if it is not enabled in your “Dev” account.
A “Dev” or developer account is always ended in “_Dev” and there will be no settlement (hence
no payout) for this type of account. Please make sure that your “Dev” account has the same
configuration in the production merchant profile to guarantee the expected test results.

PAYMENT APIs
Initiating Payment
Passing parameters to the payment gateway hosted payment page using POST/GET method via
HTTPS or SSL connection will initiate a payment request from the merchant system.
REQUEST URL
Production: https://pay.fiuu.com/RMS/pay/{MerchantID}/{Payment_Method}
Sandbox: https://sandbox-payment.fiuu.com/RMS/pay/{MerchantID}/{Payment_Method}
{MerchantID}: mandatory value to identify merchant;
{Payment_Method}: optional value to identify payment channel, only required when channel selection at
hosted payment page is disabled upon request by email; Payment channel can be identified by using
channel filename, or pass the channel parameter to index.php using GET/POST method.
The URL is an API to accept POST/GET parameters from the merchant site as well as the
payment page for buyers. For merchants who use the POST method please include the “ / “ after
{MerchantID} on the URL.
WARNING: Loading the bank login page or authorization page into iframe is not recommended
as most of the banks or channels will block all cross-origin requests and treat it as an XFS, XSS,
and CSRF attack.

abandons the payment process. HTTP POST is the only method that payment gateway returns
all parameters to a merchant's return URL for real-time status update, which the merchant can
configure in merchant admin. Merchant system should block all other methods or parameters
from an untrusted source.

Merchant is strongly recommended to implement IPN(instant payment notification) in order to
acknowledge(ACK) on the receiving of payment status from the payment gateway. There are 2
ways to implement IPN. Please refer to the IPN section for details.
Examples of Payment Endpoint
You may use the sample for all 3 endpoints, i.e. Return URL, Notification URL, and Callback URL by making
little modification based on your own requirements.
Sample return URL script for PHP
<?php
$sec_key ="xxxxxxxxxxxx"; //Replace xxxxxxxxxxxx with Secret_Key
/********************************
*Don't change below parameters
********************************/
$tranID = 	$_POST['tranID'];
$orderid = 	$_POST['orderid'];
$status = 	$_POST['status'];
$domain = 	$_POST['domain'];
$amount = 	$_POST['amount'];
$currency 	= 	$_POST['currency'];
$appcode 	= 	$_POST['appcode'];
$paydate 	= 	$_POST['paydate'];
$skey 	= 	$_POST['skey'];
/***********************************************************
* To verify the data integrity sending by PG
************************************************************/
$key0 = md5( $tranID.$orderid.$status.$domain.$amount.$currency );
$key1 = md5( $paydate.$domain.$key0.$appcode.$sec_key );
if( $skey != $key1 ) $status= -1; // Invalid transaction.
// Merchant might issue a requery to PG to double check payment status
if ( $status == "00" ) {
if ( check_cart_amt($orderid, $amount) ) {
/*** NOTE : this is a user-defined function which should be prepared by merchant ***/
// action to change cart status or to accept order
// you can also do further checking on the paydate as well
// write your script here .....
}
} else {
// failure action. Write your script here .....
// Merchant might send query to PG using Merchant requery
// to double check payment status for that particular order.
}
// Merchant is recommended to implement IPN once received the payment status
// regardless the status to acknowledge the PG

Payment Status Notification (Merchant Webhook or the 3
Endpoints)
WARNING: Please note that multiple payment notifications (either from return URL, Notification
URL or callback URL) for a single transaction is possible but this does not mean that the buyer
has paid twice or multiple times. Additionally, if the domain used for these URLs differs from the
company's website domain, it must be registered to ensure proper transaction handling.
Return URL with IPN (Instant Payment Notification)
For normal payment flow, the buyer browser is being redirected to a hosted payment page,
financial institution or channel page(if any), and then returned to the merchant website or
system. Users might close the browser any time throughout the payment process, even if the
payment is completed, successfully or failed. Another possible reason that rarely happens is the
network connectivity issue. As a result, the payment gateway is unable to update the merchant
system on the payment status. Therefore, merchants are recommended to implement IPN to
acknowledge(ACK) upon the receiving of status from gateway. Otherwise the callback worker
will resend the payment status within a time interval.
Implementation:
Step 1: Login to the merchant portal, and go to tab Transactions -> Settings, fill in the Return
URL, which must be starting with https. Return URL with IPN can be activated for better
merchant-payment system communication. Check the checkbox beside “Enable Instant
Payment Notification (IPN)”, as shown below:
Step 2: There are 2 approaches to ack on receiving payment status.
1. Simple front-end snippet: copy the Javascript (JS) code from merchant admin and paste
it on the merchant receipt page (which shows payment success/failed), preferable in the
HTML header, before </head> tag.
2. Advanced back-end scripting: merchant is to echo back all the POST variables with one
additional variable, i.e. “treq” with value 1. PHP sample code is provided below.
URL: https://pay.fiuu.com/RMS/API/chkstat/returnipn.php
Step 3: Merchant to prepare a Notification URL and Callback URL script, which is similar to
return URL script but serves at the backend, in order to receive consequent payment notification
in case the merchant system misses the first notification attempt from the payment gateway.

Notification URL with IPN
Direct payment status notification is a back-end instant update mechanism that sends over the
payment status notification from gateway directly to the merchant server or system, without
relying on any user agent such as web browser or mobile application.
Notification URL script is similar to return URL script but no output is required for front-end user
interface. This is also known as background URL.
Implementation:
Step 1: Login to merchant portal and go to tab Transactions -> Settings, fill in the Notification
URL, which must be starting with https. Notification URL with IPN can be activated for better
merchant-payment system communication. Check the checkbox beside “Enable Instant
Payment Notification (IPN)”, as shown below:
Step 2: Merchant to prepare a Notification URL script, which is similar to return URL script.
Step 3: If IPN is disabled please ignore this step. Merchants have to echo back all the POST
variables with one additional variable, i.e. “treq” with value 1. PHP sample code is provided
below.

Callback URL with IPN
Callback mechanism is a back-end activity that is initiated by payment gateway to notification
the merchant system once there are changes on any payment status.
Callback URL script is similar to return URL script. Both handle the payment status result; Unlike
the return URL script, callback URL script is to handle defer status update or all other
non-realtime payment status updates, such as Fiuu Cash payment.
Merchant must fill the Callback URL which must be starting with https in merchant portal in
order to get those non-realtime status update from the gateway. Callback URL IPN can be
activated for better merchant-payment system communication. Instead of returning all
parameters from the gateway, merchant’s callback script just need to echo
“CBTOKEN:MPSTATOK”, in plaintext, without double quotes or any HTML tags.
Merchant can actually use the same script for both callback URL & return URL, because there is
only one extra parameter in callback request, in addition to return URL parameters, which is
“nbcb”. Besides, an additional status code, 22 has been introduced for “pending” transaction
status.
Once there is a status changed event, payment gateway will POST the following parameters to
mechant callback URL. If the payment gateway could not get the actual ACK message from the
merchant, it will retry for a maximum 3 times, of 15 minutes interval for each attempt.

TL;DR?
SUMMARY ON INTEGRATION, 3 ENDPOINTS AND IPN
INTEGRATION
1) Hosted payment page or normal integration: HTTP POST/GET with all required
parameters, either to default payment channel page or to specific channel page,
merchant can allow or disallow the buyer to change payment method (PDF)
2) Seamless Integration: popup page or lightbox on merchant checkout flow, as simple
as modifying the JavaScript snippet that could be found on GitHub
3) Mobile xdk: support variety of mobile development platforms and available on GitHub
4) Direct Server API: server-to-server request that allows merchant to handle all the UI/UX
with higher flexibility and controllability (PDF)
5) Recurring API: server-to-server request that allows merchant initiated transaction
(MIT) to debit buyer account anytime (PDF)
6) Offline Payment API: For in-store e-wallet payment acceptance on POS/terminal (PDF)
7) ISO Message Interface: For card acceptance terminal vendor (restricted PDF)
3 ENDPOINTS for payment response notification (For integration 1-6 only)
1) Return URL: realtime web browser or frontend direction endpoint for hosted page,
seamless integration, and shopping cart module
2) Notification URL (webhook): real-time server-to-server or backend endpoint for all kind
of integrations
3) Callback URL (webhook): defer update or callback endpoint on non-real time payment
such as Razer Cash
IPN
1) Frontend IPN, applicable to return URL endpoint only: using JavaScript, you may copy
from the snippet code from your merchant portal, note that treq=0
2) Backend IPN for return URL and Notification URL: post back all parameters with
additional parameter treq=1 to returnipn.php
3) IPN for callback URL: just echo "CBTOKEN:MPSTATOK", without the quote(")

MERCHANT REQUEST APIs
PG has prepared plenty of merchant tools for merchants to initiate status requery and
cancellation/void of transaction. However, merchants are not allowed to send in requests too
frequently (maximum 1 query every 5 seconds). Massive incoming query will lead to IP blocking
without prior notice. There will be a validity duration to initiate a status requery API call,
generally within 1 hour after the initiated time for online payment and the due time for offline
payment.
The back-end services available are:-
1. Direct Status Requery - merchant send status query to processing bank directly
2. Indirect Status Requery - merchant send status query to PG system
3. Daily Transaction Report (Reconciliation) - list all transactions of a specific date
4. Settlement Report (Reconciliation) - settlement details
5. Capture Request - to capture any pre-auth or authorized transaction
6. Reversal Request - merchant to cancel or void a transaction or refund of payment
7. Partial Refund - for merchant who requires partial refund only
8. Partial Refund Status Inquiry by Txn ID
9. Channel Status API
10. Card BIN information API
11. Foreign Exchange Rate API
12. Void Pending-Cash API
13. Recurring Plans API
14. Payment Token API
Notes:
W.e.f 19th October 2017, Razer Merchant Services will migrate all none payment-flow related service APIs to a new FQDN:
https://api.molpay.com (and now changed to https://api.fiuu.com)
from the original https://www.onlinepayment.com.my
W.e.f 1st November 2017, Razer Merchant Services will shutdown all none payment-flow related service APIs on
https://www.onlinepayment.com.my
For sandbox environment, use https://sandbox-payment.fiuu.com

Direct Status Requery
This will trigger a query to the payment channel or bank status server and there are cases that bank
status server is not in-sync with its payment server that might give different results, that leads to a defer
update and will trigger a callback from PG server, once the status is synced and changed.
Note : No result available for transactions more than 1 day or 24 hours.

Indirect Status Requery
There are several types of status requery on PG system:-
Description & Script 	Max
Result
Count
Performance Rate
Limit
(Req/Sec)
Data Range
(Hour or
Day)
Query by unique transaction ID: q_by_tid 	1 Fast 	30 	180D
Query by order ID : q_by_oid 	1 Moderate 	10 	30D
Query by order ID & get 10 latest matched
results: q_oid_batch
10 Slow 	5 	24H / 1D
Query by multiple order ID: q_by_oids 	10 Slow 	5 	24H / 1D
Query by multiple transaction ID: q_by_tids 	10 Moderate 	10 	30D
Query by master merchant & transaction
ID: q4master_tid
1 Moderate 	10 	30D
Query by master merchant & order ID :
q4master_oid
10 Slow 	5 	24H / 1D
Status inquiry is a backup approach to get a final payment status in a proactive way, yet a more
reliable integration should be established using 3 endpoints or webhooks to obtain real-time
passive notification from the PG.
For bulk requery, best practice is to utilize one of these APIs once every half an hour for
transactions with pending and unknown status only. Excessive and rapid API calls will be
blocked without prior notice.
Note : No result available for transactions created more than 24 hours, 30 or 180 days, depending on the
API respectively.

Reversal Request
Merchant can request a reversal of transaction via original payment method for an “authorized”
card, and “captured” card (including recurring payment), M2U, CIMB Clicks, Hong Leong
Connect, Razer Pay, Alipay-Spot, POS Terminal, Boost and WeChat Pay payment.
For most of the payment channels above, the transaction can be “void” immediately on the
same day before settlement (card payment at around 10pm and other channels are 11:59pm
local time). For a payment channel that accepts refund requests, the transaction that happens
within 180 days will be refunded within 7-14 days after the request is sent.
Please note that this API is to send a refund request, but not getting the status of the refund
process. All successful requests shall be executed and if there is any exceptional case, PG
support team will contact the merchant to resolve the issue.

Advanced Full/Partial Refund
Merchants can request a full/partial refund for a “captured” or “settled” transaction regardless
of the payment method. The request can be sent within 180 days from the transaction creation
date and the refund process will take about 7-14 days after the request is sent.
Eligible merchants may request for Fiuu “Refund Portal” so as to ease their buyers to provide
bank account details to shorten the refund lead time.
For payment made via Fiuu Cash, refund will not be applicable. Merchants will need to collect
bank account information from the customers and perform wire transfer separately without
Fiuu’s involvement.

Channel Success Rate API
In order to know the healthiness of payment channels, this API allows system-wide or
merchant-only successful rate (OK rate) of a channel in real time for frequently used payment
channels. Merchants can always check the latest 1 hour system-wide OK rate of the channel
(card payment and internet banking) and a few window sizes, i.e. the latest 1, 3, 6, and 12 hours
for merchant-only OK rate for all channels, including Razer Cash. Keep in mind that Razer Cash
is not a real-time payment channel and sampling is based on payment request time and not the
time that payment is made.
This API gives a worst case scenario result, please DO NOT approach the PG support team if
your number of transactions of a specific payment channel is less than 30 or if there are
multiple failure attempts from the same buyer. Try to optimize your OK rate (success rate or SR)
if yours are far below the system-wide level. Frequent query on merchant-only OK rate might
slow down your payment processing as well.
Prompt alert or warning instead of turning off the channel at 0% or low system-wide OK rate is
always a best practice.

Idempotence Request
Idempotency allows you to retry a request multiple times while only performing the action once.
This helps avoid unwanted duplication in case of failures and retries. For example, in the case
of a timeout error, it is possible to safely retry sending the same API payment call multiple times
with the guarantee that the payment detail will only be charged once.
The accounting rules in the PG take care of most potential double-processing issues that can
impact payment modifications. To minimize unwanted side effects when requests are duplicated.
Implement idempotency
To submit a request for idempotent processing, include an idempotency-key:<key> in the
request header.
The <key> should be a unique identifier for the message, with a maximum length of 64
characters (including symbols). We recommend using a version 4 (random) UUID. If you don't
receive a response (e.g., due to a timeout), you can safely retry the request with the same
HTTP header. If the PG has already processed the request, the response from the first attempt
will be returned without duplication.
To verify that a request was processed idempotently, check the idempotency-key HTTP header
in the response.
Sample Request Header
Key 	Type Format / Max Length 	Description / Example

Jump App Integration
Certain channels, especially E-wallet support Tap & Pay functionality, enabling seamless
transactions with just a tap, primarily in a mobile device flow. To ensure proper handling of
transaction notifications, it is required to add an event listener that manages the app URL or
Universal Link, facilitating a smooth user experience and ensuring the app responds
appropriately to the incoming data.
Implementation:
1. Adds an event listener to detect when the system is redirected to a specific page
(triggered URL).
2. When an app URL or universal URL is triggered after the webview reaches a specific
page, the opened URL will be opened with new intent.
3. When a channel mobile app is opened to proceed payment, it is optional to update the
specific page and redirect it to a self setup loading page, which will have continuous
checking transaction status in a certain timeframe. (E.g. 5 minutes waiting time with 10
seconds interval time)
