SECURITY & DATA INTEGRITY
For online payment. The system uses “merchant ID”, “Verify Key” and “Secret Key” to generate
encrypted hash string to ensure data integrity in the payment process.
Verify Key [Confidential]
Verify Key is unique shared secret for PG merchants to generate request to the payment
gateway. It is a key or seed for generating one-time hash data, which are known as “vcode”
(merchant’s payment request to the gateway) or some of the “skey” (APIs’ request from
merchant to the gateway).
How to get the verify key?
1. Logon to PG Merchant Portal
2. Open up the “Transaction” drop down list in “MAIN NAVIGATION”.
3. Clink on “Settings” option
4. “Verify Key” will be listed at “Integration” tab
5. Clink on Eye Icon to show the “Verify Key”
•••••• is Merchant’s Verify Key provided by the payment gateway. Please make sure it is at least
32 characters. Merchant may request to change the key when necessary.
Secret Key [Top Secret]
Secret Key is a unique shared secret for the payment gateway to generate responses to
merchants. It is a key or seed for generating one-time hash data, which are known as “skey” (in
the payment response) or some of the “VrfKey” (APIs’ response from payment gateway).
Merchant or developer MUST NOT disclose this secret key to the public. Once the key is
suspected to be compromised, please contact PG customer service immediately to reset the
key.

Merchants who are using PG mobile xdk MUST use different strings for “Verify Key”(treat it as
public key) and “Secret Key”(treat it like private key), respectively. Contact PG customer service
to reset your keys whenever needed.
vcode (in payment request)
vcode is to ensure the data integrity passed from merchant-end (either website or mobile APP)
to the payment page to avoid man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. It uses “Verify Key”(like a public
key) in combination with the data string for hashing purposes.
It becomes mandatory for each transaction if “Enable Verify Payment” is activated in merchant
profile as shown:-
vcode was generated using MD5 encryption hash function and consists of the following
information (must be set in the following orders) :
1. Transaction amount
2. Merchant ID
3. Order ID
4. Verify Key
Extra parameters which are COMPULSORY for merchants accepting multi currency channels.
To have these values calculated in the hash. Kindly enable it from Merchant Portal

skey (in payment response)
skey is a payment gateway generated returning hash string to ensure the payment result data
integrity that passed to the merchant system. Merchants or developers MUST verify this hash
string properly and compare the order ID, currency, amount, and also the payment date/time, to
protect self interest from being cheated by a fraudster/hacker. It uses a “Secret Key”(like a
private key) in combination with a data string for the hashing process.
Please note that there are other “skey” with different formulas in Merchant Request APIs’
parameters. Try not to confuse yourself with this payment response “skey”.
skey was encrypted twice using MD5 encryption hash function and consists of the following
information (must be set in the following orders) :
First hash string
1. Transaction ID
2. Order ID
3. Status
4. Merchant ID (domain)
5. Amount
6. Currency
Final hash string
1. Payment Date/Time
2. Merchant ID (domain)

PAYMENT FLOW OVERVIEW
PG provides hosted payment page service, so that merchants do not require costly and
tech-savvy PCI-DSS compliance at merchant websites or systems. The integration is as simple
as passing parameters via HTTPS POST or GET method from merchant to PG payment page.
Buyer will proceed their transaction on internet banking or any payment channel. Once
completed, PG will redirect the buyer's front-end back to the merchant system, using the POST
method.
IPN (instant payment notification) or ACK from merchants could be implemented to confirm the
receiving of payment status updates.

Merchant needs to prepare 3 simple and similar payment endpoint scripts to handle the
payment notification from the payment gateway:
1. Return URL: front-end or browser redirection notification, which are normally not a 100%
reliable and robust channel due to unexpected network connectivity issue or client-side
behavior, such as browser application crashes;
2. Notification URL (webhook): a server-to-server back-end webhook which is more robust
and crucial for payment status or order update;
3. Callback URL (webhook): a special handler webhook to get notified on non-realtime
payment status, such as “deferred status update”, change of payment status, or Fiuu
Cash, which is not a realtime payment naturally.
After the normal payment flow, merchants can always send payment status query requests,
which is defined in reQuery APIs (a.k.a PSQ, Payment Status Query).

Domain Registration for Merchant Endpoints
The Return URL, Callback URL, Notify URL and including the Cancel URL are the endpoints
that need to be registered. It is important that a merchant register the domain if their endpoints
are different from the main website of the business. Failure to do so may result in the merchant
not receiving transaction statuses or customers not being redirected to the website when they
click the cancel button.
Steps to Register Your Domain:
1. Login to merchant portal
Navigate to https://portal.fiuu.com
2. Go to the Domain Registration Page
Navigate to the domain registration page in your merchant dashboard (UI will be
provided).
3. Enter Your Domain
Input the domain you wish to use for payment requests. Ensure it is properly formatted
and matches the domain you plan to use.
4. Submit for Verification
Once entered, submit the domain for verification by our support team.
5. Verification by Support Team
Our support team will review your domain. If everything is in order, the domain will be
approved. If there are any issues, the registration will be rejected, and you will receive
feedback on what needs to be corrected.

How to identify and report tech-related issues to PG?
Merchant needs to prepare 3 simple and similar payment endpoint scripts to handle the
payment notification from the payment gateway:
1. Return URL: front-end or browser redirection notification, which are normally not a 100%
reliable and robust channel due to unexpected network connectivity issue or client-side
behavior, such as browser application crashes;
2. Notification URL (webhook): a server-to-server back-end webhook which is more robust
and crucial for payment status or order update;
3. Callback URL (webhook): a special handler webhook to get notified on non-realtime
payment status, such as “deferred status update”, change of payment status, or Fiuu
Cash, which is not a realtime payment naturally.
After the normal payment flow, merchants can always send payment status query requests,
which is defined in reQuery APIs (a.k.a PSQ, Payment Status Query).

not receiving transaction statuses or customers not being redirected to the website when they
click the cancel button.

1. Login to merchant portal
Navigate to https://portal.fiuu.com
2. Go to the Domain Registration Page
Navigate to the domain registration page in your merchant dashboard (UI will be
provided).

Getting Payment Result
Payment results will be returned to the merchant system once payment is done or the user
abandons the payment process. HTTP POST is the only method that payment gateway returns
all parameters to a merchant's return URL for real-time status update, which the merchant can
configure in merchant admin. Merchant system should block all other methods or parameters
from an untrusted source.

Merchant is strongly recommended to implement IPN(instant payment notification) in order to
acknowledge(ACK) on the receiving of payment status from the payment gateway. There are 2
ways to implement IPN. Please refer to the IPN section for details.
Examples of Payment Endpoint
You may use the sample for all 3 endpoints, i.e. Return URL, Notification URL, and Callback URL by making
little modification based on your own requirements.
Sample return URL script for PHP
<?php
$sec_key ="xxxxxxxxxxxx"; //Replace xxxxxxxxxxxx with Secret_Key
/********************************
*Don't change below parameters
********************************/
$tranID = 	$_POST['tranID'];
$orderid = 	$_POST['orderid'];
$status = 	$_POST['status'];
$domain = 	$_POST['domain'];
$amount = 	$_POST['amount'];
$currency 	= 	$_POST['currency'];
$appcode 	= 	$_POST['appcode'];
$paydate 	= 	$_POST['paydate'];
$skey 	= 	$_POST['skey'];
/***********************************************************
* To verify the data integrity sending by PG
************************************************************/
$key0 = md5( $tranID.$orderid.$status.$domain.$amount.$currency );
$key1 = md5( $paydate.$domain.$key0.$appcode.$sec_key );
if( $skey != $key1 ) $status= -1; // Invalid transaction.
// Merchant might issue a requery to PG to double check payment status
if ( $status == "00" ) {
if ( check_cart_amt($orderid, $amount) ) {
/*** NOTE : this is a user-defined function which should be prepared by merchant ***/
// action to change cart status or to accept order
//

ack on receiving payment status.
1. Simple front-end snippet: copy the Javascript (JS) code from merchant admin and paste
it on the merchant receipt page (which shows payment success/failed), preferable in the
HTML header, before </head> tag.
2. Advanced back-end scripting: merchant is to echo back all the POST variables with one
additional variable, i.e. “treq” with value 1. PHP sample code is provided below.
URL: https://pay.fiuu.com/RMS/API/chkstat/returnipn.php
Step 3: Merchant to prepare a Notification URL and Callback URL script, which is similar to
return URL script but serves at the backend, in order to receive consequent payment notification
in case the merchant system misses the first notification attempt from the payment gateway.

Example of back-end IPN script for PHP (combined with return URL script)

$tranID = 	$_POST['tranID'];

PAYMENT FLOW OVERVIEW
PG provides hosted payment page service, so that merchants do not require costly and
tech-savvy PCI-DSS compliance at merchant websites or systems. The integration is as simple
as passing parameters via HTTPS POST or GET method from merchant to PG payment page.
Buyer will proceed their transaction on internet banking or any payment channel. Once
completed, PG will redirect the buyer's front-end back to the merchant system, using the POST
method.
IPN (instant payment notification) or ACK from merchants could be implemented to confirm the
receiving of payment status updates.

PAYMENT APIs
Initiating Payment
Passing parameters to the payment gateway hosted payment page using POST/GET method via
HTTPS or SSL connection will initiate a payment request from the merchant system.
REQUEST URL
Production: https://pay.fiuu.com/RMS/pay/{MerchantID}/{Payment_Method}
Sandbox: https://sandbox-payment.fiuu.com/RMS/pay/{MerchantID}/{Payment_Method}
{MerchantID}: mandatory value to identify merchant;
{Payment_Method}: optional value to identify payment channel, only required when channel selection at
hosted payment page is disabled upon request by email; Payment channel can be identified by using
channel filename, or pass the channel parameter to index.php using GET/POST method.
The URL is an API to accept POST/GET parameters from the merchant site as well as the
payment page for buyers. For merchants who use the POST method please include the “ / “ after
{MerchantID} on the URL.
WARNING: Loading the bank login page or authorization page into iframe is not recommended
as most of the banks or channels will block all cross-origin requests and treat it as an XFS, XSS,

Dealing with banks and multiple payment channels are time-consuming and it might cost you a

parameters. Try not to confuse yourself with this payment response “skey”.
skey was encrypted twice using MD5 encryption hash function and consists of the following
information (must be set in the following orders) :
First hash string
1. Transaction ID
2. Order ID
3. Status
4. Merchant ID (domain)
5. Amount
6. Currency
Final hash string
1. Payment Date/Time
2. Merchant ID (domain)
3. First hash string
4. Approval Code
5. Secret Key
Formula to generate skey
pre_skey = md5( {txnID}{orderID}{status}{merchantID}{amount}{currency} )
skey = md5( {paydate}{merchantID}{pre_skey}{appcode}{secret_key} )
Example to generate skey for PHP developer

SECURITY & DATA INTEGRITY
For online payment. The system uses “merchant ID”, “Verify Key” and “Secret Key” to generate
encrypted hash string to ensure data integrity in the payment process.
Verify Key [Confidential]
Verify Key is unique shared secret for PG merchants to generate request to the payment
gateway. It is a key or seed for generating one-time hash data, which are known as “vcode”
(merchant’s payment request to the gateway) or some of the “skey” (APIs’ request from
merchant to the gateway).
How to get the verify key?
1. Logon to PG Merchant Portal
2. Open up the “Transaction” drop down list in “MAIN NAVIGATION”.
3. Clink on “Settings” option
4. “Verify Key” will be listed at “Integration” tab
5. Clink on Eye Icon to show the “Verify Key”

the data integrity passed from merchant-end (either website or mobile APP)
to the payment page to avoid man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. It uses “Verify Key”(like a public
key) in combination with the data string for hashing purposes.
It becomes mandatory for each transaction if “Enable Verify Payment” is activated in merchant
profile as shown:-
vcode was generated using MD5 encryption hash function and consists of the following
information (must be set in the following orders) :
1. Transaction amount
2. Merchant ID
3. Order ID
4. Verify Key
Extra parameters which are COMPULSORY for merchants accepting multi currency channels.
To have these values calculated in the hash. Kindly enable it from Merchant Portal
(Transactions -> Settings). Enable the option “Use extended format for Verify Payment” to
